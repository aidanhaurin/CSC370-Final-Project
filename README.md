# CSC370-Final-Project
A neural network co-developed with Nicholas Maye as part of a final project for La Salle University's CSC370 "Introduction to Deep Learning" course of the Spring 2024 semester.

## What was this project exactly?

A two-person group project where I primarily designed and coded a neural network in Python to sort hexadecimal values from a given dataset file taken online into predefined one-word color categories. I also generated graphs to illustrate changes in loss and accuracy during the training phase and saved the final parameters after training for reuse.

## Will you ever update it?

Probably not? I could maybe make a webpage for testing the model online but the model itself is more or less complete, I think.
