# My CSC370 Final Project
A neural network co-developed with Nicholas Maye as part of a final project for La Salle University's CSC370 "Introduction to Deep Learning" course of the Spring 2024 semester.
<br>

## What was this project exactly?
A two-person group project where I primarily designed and coded a neural network in Python to sort hexadecimal values from a given dataset file taken online into predefined one-word color categories. I also generated graphs to illustrate changes in loss and accuracy during the training phase and saved the final parameters after training for reuse.
<br>

## Will you ever update it?
Probably not? I could maybe make a webpage for testing the model online but the model itself is more or less complete, I think.
<br>

## Resources Used
- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google/)
- [PyTorch Library](https://pytorch.org/)
- ["colors.jsonl", a database of colors I found on Huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/datasets/burkelibbey/colors/blob/main/colors.jsonl)
<br>

## Credits
- Nicholas Maye, who is responsible for co-presenting the project
- Professor Yuehan Yin, who taught the course
- Burke Libbey, author of the Huggingface database used
